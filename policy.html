    <h1>Make your own policy.</h1>

    <p>Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a
        statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a
        governance body within an organization. Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making.
        Policies used in subjective decision-making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based
        on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result, are often hard to test objectively, e.g.
        workâ€“life balance policy... Moreover, Governments and other institutions have policies in the form of laws,
        regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentiv and voluntary practices. Frequently, resource
        allocations mirror policy decisions.

        In contrast, policies to assist in objective decision-making are usually operational in nature and can be
        objectively tested, e.g. password policy.[1]

        The term may apply to government, public sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals, Presidential
        executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy.
        Policy differs from rules or law. While the law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the
        payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve the
        desired outcome.[2]

        Policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the
        identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the
        basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, managerial, financial, and
        administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a critical accounting
        policy is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective
        element, and that has a material impact on the financial statements.[citation needed]</p>
